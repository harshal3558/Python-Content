# Files Practice problems and solutions
# Write a function display_words() in python to read lines from a text file "story.txt", and display unique words, which are less than 4 characters. Keep in mind "the" and "The" are two different values.
# The content of the file is given below.

# "India is the fastest-growing economy. India is looking for more investments around the globe. The whole world is looking at India as a great market. Most of the Indians can foresee the heights that India is capable of reaching."

# For Example:-

# def display_words(file):
#     ### your code here

# file = your/path/to/story.txt
# display_words(file1)

# >>> ['the', 'for', 'The', 'as', 'at', 'is', 'can', 'a', 'of']
# Aditi has used a text editing software to type some text. After saving the article as words.txt, she realised that she has wrongly typed alphabet J in place of alphabet I everywhere in the article.
# Your task is to write a function named as JTOI() such that it would display the corrected version of entire content of the file words.txt with all the alphabets "J" to be displayed as an alphabet "I" on screen.

# Note: Assuming that words.txt contains wrongly typed J alphabet otherwise.

# Example:

# If Aditi has stored the following content in the file WORDS.TXT:

# "WELL, THJS JS A WORD BY JTSELF. YOU COULD STRETCH THJS TO BE A SENTENCE."

# The function JTOI() should display the following content:

# "WELL, THIS IS A WORD BY ITSELF. YOU COULD STRETCH THIS TO BE A SENTENCE."

# After creating the file you have to write a function search_regex() that takes a filepath and a regex as arguments. The function should return all the occurrence of text that matches the regex in the file.
